        <h2>Where It All Began</h2>
        <p>
          Spirit Animals Sanctuary was born out of a deep love for animals and a
          desire to give them the life they deserve. In a quiet corner of
          Bucovina, Romania, what started as a dream soon grew into a haven for
          over 90 rescued animals—each with their own story, struggles, and
          spark.

        <h2>Building a Sanctuary</h2>
        <p>
          Brick by brick, with help from volunteers and donors, the sanctuary
          took shape. It became a space of healing, where animals once destined
          for slaughter found safety, freedom, and unconditional love.

        <h2>A Growing Family</h2>
        <p>
          Today, we’re more than a sanctuary—we’re a movement. With the support
          of over 11,000 people, we continue to rescue, rehabilitate, and
          advocate for animals across Romania and beyond. Our story is far from
          over—it's just getting started.
